Decision Tree Sorting
Decision Tree Sorting is a Flask-based web application that demonstrates the integration of decision tree algorithms with sorting techniques. The project provides an interactive platform to visualize and analyze decision tree-based sorting processes, compare sorting algorithm performance, and explore their applications through a user-friendly interface.

Features

Decision Tree Implementation: Build and visualize decision trees for sorting or classification tasks.
Sorting Algorithms: Compare performance of various sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort).
Web Interface: Interactive UI built with Flask, Jinja2 templates, and static assets (CSS/JavaScript).
Analysis Tools: Generate performance metrics and visualizations for algorithms.
Modular Design: Organized codebase with separate modules for decision trees, sorting, and analysis.
