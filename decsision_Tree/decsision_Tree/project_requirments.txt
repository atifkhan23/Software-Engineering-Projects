Below is a detailed 7-day implementation plan that uses Flask for the backend (integrating it only where necessary) while delivering all the required features.

---

### **Day 1: Project Setup & Architecture Planning**

- **Environment & Repository Setup**
  - Create a new repository and set up a virtual environment.
  - Install necessary Python packages (Flask, any visualization libraries, etc.).
- **Architecture Planning**
  - Decide on the project structure (e.g., separate modules for sorting algorithms, decision tree generation, web routes, and analysis).
  - Outline key data structures for recording comparisons, swaps, and tree nodes.
- **Tooling Decisions**
  - Confirm usage of Flask for backend API endpoints.
  - Choose a front-end framework (e.g., React.js or Vue.js) if a dynamic UI is needed.
  - Plan for integrating a visualization library (e.g., D3.js) for tree displays.

---

### **Day 2: Sorting Algorithms Implementation & Tracking**

- **Implement Sorting Algorithms in Python**
  - Code key algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
  - Modify implementations to track comparisons and swaps.
- **Data Logging**
  - Store operations (comparisons, swaps) in a structured format (such as a list of step objects) that will later be converted into nodes for decision tree generation.
- **Unit Testing**
  - Write simple tests to validate that each algorithm sorts correctly and logs operations accurately.

---

### **Day 3: Decision Tree Generation Module**

- **Tree Construction**
  - Develop a module that translates the operation logs into decision trees.
  - For small input sizes (e.g., n ≤ 4), generate the full decision tree.
- **Annotations**
  - Integrate annotations in the tree: label each node with comparisons, swap details, and the state of the list.
- **Handling Large Trees**
  - Design the tree data structure to support splitting into subtrees for large inputs.
  - Prototype functionality that lets a user choose specific subtrees to view.

---

### **Day 4: Flask Backend Development**

- **API Endpoints**
  - Create endpoints for:
    - Running a chosen sorting algorithm on a given list size.
    - Retrieving the generated decision tree (or subtrees) in JSON format.
    - Accessing average-case analysis results.
- **Backend Logic**
  - Integrate the sorting algorithms and decision tree generation modules.
  - If the tool’s functionality can be performed client-side (for small inputs), keep backend interactions minimal; otherwise, handle heavier computations via Flask.
- **Testing**
  - Test endpoints using tools like Postman to ensure data integrity and proper responses.

---

### **Day 5: Frontend Development & Visualization**

- **User Interface Design**
  - Develop a clean, user-friendly interface where users can:
    - Select sorting algorithms from a dropdown menu.
    - Input a list size (with limits for larger sizes).
    - Trigger sorting and view the resulting decision tree.
- **Visualization Integration**
  - Utilize a visualization library (like D3.js) to render decision trees.
  - Ensure that the tree display includes annotations (comparisons, swaps, final sorted state).
  - Provide interactivity (e.g., zooming in/out, selecting specific subtrees).
- **API Integration**
  - Connect the front end with the Flask backend endpoints to fetch data dynamically.

---

### **Day 6: Average-Case Analysis & Backend-Frontend Integration**

- **Average-Case Analysis Module**
  - Develop a module to run sample tests on sorting algorithms.
  - Compute average-case path lengths and compare with Yao’s lower bound.
  - Include examples for different tree configurations (balanced, imbalanced).
- **Integration Testing**
  - Combine the Flask backend with the frontend visualizations.
  - Test full user flows: algorithm selection, list input, tree visualization, and analysis results.
- **Debugging & Refinement**
  - Address any integration issues, refine API responses, and ensure the visualization accurately reflects the underlying data.

---

  ### **Day 7: Final Testing, Documentation & Deployment Preparation**

  - **Comprehensive Testing**
    - Perform end-to-end testing of all modules.
    - Validate that:
      - Sorting algorithms log operations correctly.
      - Decision trees display all required annotations.
      - Subtree selection works for larger inputs.
      - Average-case analysis aligns with expected results.
  - **Documentation & Reporting**
    - Write detailed documentation covering:
      - System architecture and module design.
      - Instructions for setting up and running the project.
      - Analysis of average-case time complexity versus Yao’s bound.
      - User guide for the web interface.
  - **Deployment Considerations**
    - If required, prepare a simple deployment configuration (e.g., using Flask’s built-in server or a lightweight WSGI server) to showcase the working tool.
  - **Final Review**
    - Package the final deliverables:
      - Python scripts for sorting algorithms and decision tree tracking.
      - Flask backend code.
      - Frontend code for the web interface and decision tree visualization.
      - Analysis module and documentation/report.

  This plan ensures that you cover all required functionalities within 7 days while utilizing Flask for necessary backend processing. It keeps the backend minimal if not strictly needed (for small inputs or simple operations) but fully integrates it for heavy computations and API management when required.
